This allows you to close a buffer in Vim without affecting the window
it's in.  Normally when you close a buffer, its window closes too,
forcing you to re-layout all your windows.

If you hit ^W^E, the buffer closes and your windows remain untouched.

TODO: just discovered http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2103
which appears to be even better?
There also appears to be http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1147
but it looks more complex than necessary?
